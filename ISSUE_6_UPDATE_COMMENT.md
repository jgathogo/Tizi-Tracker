## ✅ Manual Attempt Number Editing Added

The ability to manually specify attempt numbers for each exercise has been added! This allows you to set different attempt numbers for different exercises when starting a workout.

### What's New:

#### Manual Attempt Editing:
- ✅ **Clickable Attempt Badge** - Click on the attempt number badge (e.g., "(1)", "(2)") in any exercise card to edit it
- ✅ **Per-Exercise Control** - Each exercise can have its own attempt number, independent of others
- ✅ **Flexible Starting** - Perfect for when different exercises are at different stages when you start using the app

### How It Works:

1. **During Workout:**
   - Click on the attempt number badge next to the exercise name
   - Enter the desired attempt number (1, 2, 3, etc.)
   - The attempt number is updated immediately

2. **Example Use Case:**
   - Starting a workout where:
     - Squat is at 50kg (1st attempt)
     - Overhead Press is at 35kg (1st attempt)  
     - Deadlift is at 45kg (2nd attempt)
   - Simply click each attempt badge and set the correct number

3. **Automatic Tracking:**
   - After you manually set an attempt number, the app continues to track it automatically
   - On next workout, attempt increments as normal
   - Or you can manually adjust again if needed

### Technical Details:
- Attempt numbers are saved per exercise in the workout session
- Also updates the user profile's `exerciseAttempts` for standard 5x5 workouts
- Works seamlessly with the automatic progression logic
- Manual edits take precedence over automatic tracking

The feature is ready to use! You can now specify attempt numbers for each exercise individually. 🎉
